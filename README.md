* Jamaican Creole Dictionary Web App

This app is a frontend for the Jamaican Creole Dictionary [here](https://github.com/joshcwinton/jcr-dictionary). It will allow users to input a Jamaican Creole word and get back a definition if one has been entered, as well as a list of occurrences from the Jamaican New Testament. Eventually, authorized users will be able to view and edit definitions using this frontend. It would also be nice to eventually update the dictionary to include scriptures from the Jamaican New World Translation. A long term project could include an explore page with insights about the words in the dictionary.

** To do list
